Relevant Experience
Senior Site Reliability Engineer | Ford Motor Company 
September 2024 - Present
Strategic Initiatives
* Architected Enterprise Cache Management Platform (IDP): Designed and developed a unified Next.js/OpenShift portal to centralize cache management for Akamai (Edge) and Redis (Backend).
   * Impact: Consolidated disparate cache tools into a single pane of glass, streamlining 100+ daily requests via a self-service model.
   * Governance: Enforced strict RBAC (Production vs. QA) and established full audit trails using GCP Logs.
   * FinOps: Decommissioned legacy Jenkins infrastructure by engineering a custom internal scheduling engine, resulting in significant monthly cloud cost reductions.
* Centralized SRE & Observability-as-Code: Leading the technical transition to a Central SRE model, scaling support to 250+ applications without increasing headcount.




   * Automation: Developed modular Terraform libraries and GitOps workflows (ArgoCD) to auto-provision Dashboards, SLOs, and Alerts, reducing project onboarding time from days to minutes.
* SRE AI Assistant & Automation: Engineered a GenAI assistant using Ford’s native LLM and Akamai/ServiceNow APIs to automate incident triage and root cause analysis.
   * Impact: Reduced Mean Time To Resolution (MTTR) for critical incidents by 30% through automated log analysis.
Core Responsibilities
* Cloud-Native CI/CD (Tekton): Architected and managed modern Tekton pipelines on OpenShift to automate the deployment of SRE-led initiatives, ensuring high availability and seamless rollouts.
* SLO & Error Budget Adoption: Spearheaded the adoption of SLOs and Error Budget policies across 4 Vehicle Commerce products, establishing a data-driven framework to balance feature velocity with system reliability.
* Proactive Health Monitoring: Built custom Python web crawlers to detect broken URLs and assets proactively, significantly reducing client-side errors and improving user experience.
* Unified Dashboarding: Developed a custom Next.js dashboard to provide development teams with a real-time, holistic view of application health and error budget consumption.
